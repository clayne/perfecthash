    [BulkCreateFlags] [KeysLoadFlags] [TableCreateFlags]
    [TableCompileFlags] [TableCreateParameters]

Bulk Create Flags:

    N/A

Keys Load Flags:

    --TryLargePagesForKeysData

        Tries to allocate the keys buffer using large pages.

Table Create Flags:

    --FirstGraphWins [default]

        The first graph that is found is the one used.  This is the default
        behavior.

    --FindBestGraph

        Requires the following two table create parameters to be present:

            --BestCoverageNumAttempts=N

                Where N is a positive integer, and represents the number of
                attempts that will be made at finding a "best" graph (based
                on the best coverage type requested below) before the create
                table routine returns.

            --BestCoverageType=<CoverageType>

                Indicates the predicate to determine what constitutes the best
                graph.

                Valid coverage types:

                    HighestNumberOfEmptyCacheLines

Table Compile Flags:

    N/A

Table Create Parameters:

    --AttemptsBeforeTableResize=N [default = 18]

        Specifies the number of attempts at solving the graph that will be made
        before a table resize event will occur (assuming that resize events are
        permitted, as per the following flag).

    --MaxNumberOfTableResizes=N [default = 5]

        Maximum number of table resizes that will be permitted before giving up.

    See also the --BestCoverage* parameters listed above in the table create
    flag's --FindBestGraph section.
